Emerald, known as Panna in Hindi, is the gemstone of the planet Mercury (Budh) and holds a special place in Vedic astrology due to its profound impact on intelligence, communication, and financial prosperity. Individuals with a weak or afflicted Mercury in their birth chart are often advised to wear an Emerald to enhance their mental clarity, articulation skills, and decision-making power.

Panna is considered ideal for students, business professionals, writers, and orators as it sharpens memory, improves analytical thinking, and promotes intellectual growth. It also plays a crucial role in healing emotional wounds, reducing nervous tension, and encouraging spiritual growth. In relationships, Emerald supports loyalty and mutual understanding, fostering harmony and peace.

Emeralds should be worn on Wednesdays, preferably set in gold or silver, on the little finger. The gem must be activated through Vedic rituals for optimal effects. It is important to ensure the Emerald is natural and untreated, as synthetic stones lack astrological efficacy.
